# Cavalcade Demo

This project demos how to get started with [Cavalcade](https://github.com/freerobby/cavalcade), a lightweight infrastructure for using [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) as a stand-alone job queue.

The easiest way to get started is to fork this project, rename it to whatever you want, then add your own documentation to this README.
